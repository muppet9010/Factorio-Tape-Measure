# Factorio-Tape-Measure

Is a free in-game tool that can measure the distances between 2 points or a selected area. It will tell you the distance in both inclusive tiles and raw distance.

If you single left click with the tool it will make a tiny selection box and the mod will detect this as a point. Points will be measured in sequentially clicked pairs.
If you left click and hold with the tool it will show the selection box and when you release the selected area will be measured. A selection of less than 1 tile will be recognised as a click.
If you right click (configurable) with the tool held it will be disposed of.

The tool can be used via the map when zoomed in to see things properly.
When you use the tape measure tool the mods GUI will open to show the results. Closing the GUI will clear the results.
You can obtain the tape measure item via the mod's in-game button in the top left corner or via a configurable shortcut (default: Control M)
You can discard the tape measure item from your inventory by right-clicking on it.
The mod button in the top left can be hidden via a per player mod setting. Useful for when using the shortcut to obtain the tape measure and you want to reduce mod icon clutter on the screen.
