If you single click with the tool it will make a tiny selection box and the mod will detect this as a point. Points will be measured in sequentially clicked pairs.
If you click and hold with the tool it will show the selection box and when you release the selected area will be measured. A selectilon of less than 1 tile will be recognised as a click.
The tool can be used via the minimap.

You can obtain the tape measure item via the mod's ingame button in the top left corner.
You can discard the tape measure item from your inventory by right clicking on it.
When you use the tape measure the mods Gui will open to show the results. Closing the Gui will clear the results.
